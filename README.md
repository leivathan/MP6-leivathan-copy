# MP6-leivathan-copy
This is my (Andrew Kim's) copy of the code for Machine Project 6, JSON and Android, for the 2018 spring semester of the class CS 125, Introduction to Computer Science, at the University of Illinois. The purpose of this project was to both partially develop an app and to work with APIs and JSONs.
The goal of the project was to use Microsoft's Cognitive Services API to identify pictures of the celebrity Rick Astley within an Android application. The code which I, Andrew Kim, worked on is labeled with commits that start with the phrase "Finally understood how the parser works. Seems easy enough."
More information on the project can be found on the course archive: https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/MP/2018/spring/6/
